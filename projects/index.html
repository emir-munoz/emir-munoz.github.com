	<li><b>LaTex template for thesis USACH</b><br>
	While I was doing my thesis I built a LaTex template following the official format. 
	This template can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/emir-munoz/thesisLatex">here</a>. 
	If you like also can use an online LaTex compiler available <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">here</a>, 
	where you can upload the previous folder and compile using pdflatex.
	</li>
	<li><b>XML Constraints</b><br>
	This was my master's thesis topic. In <a href="http://emunoz.org/xml-constraints/">this repo</a> I uploaded
	some resources used in a submitted paper to WWW 2013 conference. With the results of my thesis we submitted the paper 
	<a href="http://slink.foiks.org/Articles/DEXA12.pdf">"Performance Analysis of Algorithms to Reason about XML Keys"</a>, 
	published in DEXA 2012, with which we earned the best paper award.

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
