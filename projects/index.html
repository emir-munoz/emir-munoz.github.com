<p>This is a list of relevant projects and done works in which I am now or have been involved:</p>

	<li><span class="highauthor">Wikitables</span><br>
	We propose that existing RDF knowledge-bases can be leveraged to extract facts (in the form of RDF triples) from relational HTML tables 
	on the Web with high accuracy. In particular, we propose methods using the DBpedia knowledge-base to extract facts from tables embedded 
	in Wikipedia articles (henceforth "Wikitables"), effectively enriching DBpedia with additional triples. We first survey the Wikitables 
	from a recent dump of Wikipedia to see how much raw data can potentially be exploited by our methods. We then propose methods to extract 
	RDF from these tables: we map table cells to DBpedia entities and, for cells in the same row, we isolate a set of candidate relationships 
	based on existing information in DBpedia for other rows. To improve accuracy, we investigate various machine learning methods to classify 
	extracted triples as correct or incorrect. We ultimately extract 7.9 million unique novel triples from one million Wikitables at an 
	estimated precision of 81.5%.<br>

	<li><span class="highauthor">LODPeas: Like peas in a LOD (cloud)</span><br>
	We present <a href="http://lodpeas.org" target="_blank">LODPeas</a>: a system for browsing entities that are found to share many things 
	in common in an RDF dataset. The system first offers standard keyword search to locate a focus entity. Once a focus entity 
	has been found, other entities that share a lot in common with it are displayed in a graph-based visualisation. The degree 
	to which two entities have a lot in common---their level of concurrence---is scored by looking at attributes (property--value pairs) 
	that they share: attributes that are shared by few other entities are given higher weight, and additional shared attributes 
	imply a stronger score. LODPeas is designed to scale for billions of triples and is built in an (almost) entirely domain-agnostic 
	fashion, built on top of the RDF standards themselves and not requiring any domain-specific input. Herein, we describe the 
	functionality of LODPeas, how the system was built over the BTC'12, and discuss possible applications.<br>

	<li><span class="highauthor">XML Constraints</span><br>
	This was my master's thesis topic. In <a href="http://emunoz.org/xml-constraints/" target="_blank">this repository</a> you can be found
	some resources used in some submitted papers to different conferences. With the results of my thesis we submitted the paper 
	<a href="http://emunoz.org/publications/files/DEXA12.pdf" target="_blank">Performance Analysis of Algorithms to Reason about XML Keys</a>, 
	published in DEXA 2012, with which we earned the best paper award.<br>
	<a href="http://emunoz.org/xml-constraints/" target="_blank">[website]</a>
	</li>
	
	<li><span class="highauthor">LaTex template for thesis USACH</span><br>
	While I was doing my thesis I built a LaTex template following the official format from Universidad de Santiago de Chile. 
	This template can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/emir-munoz/thesisLatex" target="_blank">here</a>. 
	If you like also can use an online LaTex compiler available <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, 
	where you can upload the previous folder and compile using pdflatex.<br> 
	TODO: Upload the post-graduate version and generate a wiki with the steps to use these templates.<br>

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
