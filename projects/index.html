This is a list of relevant projects in which I am now, have been involved:<br>

<ol>
	<li><b>LaTex template for thesis USACH</b><br>
	While I was doing my thesis I built a LaTex template following the official format. 
	This template can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/emir-munoz/thesisLatex">here</a>. 
	If you like also can use an online LaTex compiler available <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">here</a>, 
	where you can upload the previous folder and compile using pdflatex.<br>

	<li><b>XML Constraints</b><br>
	This was my master's thesis topic. In <a href="http://emunoz.org/xml-constraints/">this repo</a> I uploaded
	some resources used in a submitted paper to WWW 2013 conference. With the results of my thesis we submitted the paper 
	<a href="http://slink.foiks.org/Articles/DEXA12.pdf">"Performance Analysis of Algorithms to Reason about XML Keys"</a>, 
	published in DEXA 2012, with which we earned the best paper award.<br>

	<li><b>LODPeas: Like peas in a LOD (cloud)</b><br>
	We present <a href="http://lodpeas.org">LODPeas</a>: a system for browsing entities that are found to share many things 
	in common in an RDF dataset. The system first offers standard keyword search to locate a focus entity. Once a focus entity 
	has been found, other entities that share a lot in common with it are displayed in a graph-based visualisation. The degree 
	to which two entities have a lot in common---their level of concurrence---is scored by looking at attributes (property--value pairs) 
	that they share: attributes that are shared by few other entities are given higher weight, and additional shared attributes 
	imply a stronger score. LODPeas is designed to scale for billions of triples and is built in an (almost) entirely domain-agnostic 
	fashion, built on top of the RDF standards themselves and not requiring any domain-specific input. Herein, we describe the 
	functionality of LODPeas, how the system was built over the BTC'12, and discuss possible applications.<br>
